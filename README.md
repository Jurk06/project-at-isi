# Introduction:  
As we know that world is facing huge crisis of water. There is scarcity of drinkable water. Beside that in India the reliability of water heavily depends upon the wells, ponds etc. This has triggered the crisis. The aim of this project is to analyse the dataset that I received form my Prof. A.B (ISI Kolkata) and analysis of missing features and a solution to impute the missing values


# Dataset:
The dataset is of csv format, pandas library helps to read the csv dataset. Beside that we import some bunch of library in order to future work.

# [ANOVA Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/jurk06/one-way-anova-analysis) 
It is perfomed in order to get that the significant difference between the independent variables and the featurs. Here I have performed One-way analysis as there is only one independent features we have.
